      <br>Tetris is played on a 12 by 20 grid called the Matrix.
      Tetriminos in 7 different shapes fall from the top of the Matrix and come to rest at the bottom.
      Only one Tetrimino falls at a time.
      At first the Tetriminos fall rather slowly; as the game progresses they will fall faster and faster.
      The primary way to score points in Tetris is to clear lines by manipulating the pieces so that they fill horizontal row within the Matrix.
      As the pieces fall, your goal is to move and spin them so that they line up evenly at the bottom of the Matrix.
      To clear a line, every square of the row has to be filled.
